# ONLINE-AUCTION-SYSTEMM
Online Auction System Backend

This project is the backend of an Online Auction System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB (via Mongoose), and JWT-based authentication. It enables users to register, log in, post items for auction, and place bids on listed items. Key features include:

User registration and authentication (with password hashing using bcrypt)

JWT token-based session management

Item listing and bidding endpoints

MongoDB data persistence via Mongoose

CORS-enabled API for frontend integration

This project is ideal for learning how to build a RESTful API with modern web technologies and secure user interactions.
